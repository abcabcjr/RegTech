# TLS Cipher Strength Integration with Cipher Analysis - Examples

## Overview
The new `tls_cipher_strength.lua` script provides comprehensive TLS cipher strength detection and assessment that integrates with existing cipher analysis to determine compliance status.

## Key Integration Features

### 1. TLS Service Detection Integration
- **Banner Grab Dependency**: Uses `banner_grab.lua` results for TLS service identification
- **Multi-Method Detection**: Banner analysis → Banner content → Port-based detection
- **Service Confidence**: Inherits confidence levels from banner grab results
- **TLS Port Recognition**: Automatically identifies common TLS/SSL ports

### 2. Comprehensive Cipher Strength Assessment
- **Basic TLS Connection Test** (20 points): Verifies TLS connectivity
- **Modern Server Detection** (10 points): Identifies modern server software
- **HTTP/2 Support** (15 points): Detects HTTP/2 (requires strong ciphers)
- **HSTS Implementation** (10 points): Rewards security header presence
- **Legacy Client Rejection** (5 points): Bonus for rejecting weak clients
- **Modern Client Support** (10 points): Confirms strong cipher negotiation

### 3. Compliance Integration with Cipher Analysis
- **Dual Checklist Support**: `tls-cipher-strength-016` and `cryptographic-controls-017`
- **Score-Based Assessment**: 0-100 point scoring system
- **Vulnerability Detection**: Identifies cipher-related security issues
- **Feature Recognition**: Detects modern TLS features and capabilities

## Test Scenarios and Expected Results

### Scenario 1: Strong TLS Configuration (COMPLIANT)
```
Input: example.com:443/tcp
Banner Grab: service.port.443 = "https", banner contains "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"

TLS Cipher Strength Assessment:
  - Basic TLS Connection: ✅ +20 points
  - Modern Server (nginx/1.20): ✅ +10 points
  - HTTP/2 Support: ✅ +15 points
  - HSTS Header: ✅ +10 points
  - Legacy Client Rejected: ✅ +5 points
  - Modern Client Success: ✅ +10 points
  - Security Headers: ✅ +10 points
  - Certificate Consistency: ✅ +6 points
  - Total: 86/100 (86%)

Result: COMPLIANT (Strong)
Cipher Strength: "strong"
Checklists: PASS tls-cipher-strength-016, PASS cryptographic-controls-017
Tags: tls-cipher-compliant, strong-encryption, strong-cipher-suites
Features: modern_server, http2_support, hsts
```

### Scenario 2: Acceptable TLS Configuration (COMPLIANT)
```
Input: example.com:8443/tcp
Banner Grab: service.port.8443 = "https-alt", banner contains "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"

TLS Cipher Strength Assessment:
  - Basic TLS Connection: ✅ +20 points
  - Modern Server: ❌ 0 points (older Apache)
  - HTTP/2 Support: ❌ 0 points
  - HSTS Header: ✅ +10 points
  - Legacy Client Rejected: ✅ +5 points
  - Modern Client Success: ✅ +10 points
  - Security Headers: ⚠️ +5 points (partial)
  - Certificate Consistency: ✅ +6 points
  - Total: 56/100 (56%) -> Actually NON_COMPLIANT

Result: NON_COMPLIANT (score too low, but let's adjust example)
  
Adjusted Assessment (more realistic):
  - Basic TLS Connection: ✅ +20 points
  - Modern Server: ⚠️ +5 points (Apache 2.4)
  - HTTP/2 Support: ❌ 0 points
  - HSTS Header: ✅ +10 points
  - Legacy Client Rejected: ✅ +5 points
  - Modern Client Success: ✅ +10 points
  - Security Headers: ✅ +10 points
  - Certificate Consistency: ✅ +6 points
  - Brotli Support: ✅ +5 points
  - Total: 71/100 (71%)

Result: COMPLIANT (Acceptable)
Cipher Strength: "acceptable"
Checklists: PASS tls-cipher-strength-016, PASS cryptographic-controls-017
Tags: tls-cipher-compliant, acceptable-cipher-suites
Features: hsts
```

### Scenario 3: Weak TLS Configuration (PARTIALLY_COMPLIANT)
```
Input: example.com:443/tcp
Banner Grab: service.port.443 = "https", banner contains "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"

TLS Cipher Strength Assessment:
  - Basic TLS Connection: ✅ +20 points
  - Modern Server: ❌ 0 points
  - HTTP/2 Support: ❌ 0 points
  - HSTS Header: ❌ 0 points
  - Legacy Client Accepted: ❌ -10 points (vulnerability)
  - Modern Client Success: ✅ +10 points
  - Security Headers: ❌ 0 points
  - Certificate Consistency: ⚠️ +4 points
  - Total: 24/100 (24%) -> Actually NON_COMPLIANT

Let's adjust for PARTIALLY_COMPLIANT example:
  - Basic TLS Connection: ✅ +20 points
  - Modern Server: ❌ 0 points
  - HTTP/2 Support: ❌ 0 points
  - HSTS Header: ❌ 0 points
  - Legacy Client Rejected: ✅ +5 points
  - Modern Client Success: ✅ +10 points
  - Security Headers: ⚠️ +5 points
  - Certificate Consistency: ✅ +6 points
  - Server Info Disclosure: ❌ -3 points
  - Total: 43/100 (43%) -> Still NON_COMPLIANT

Better PARTIALLY_COMPLIANT example:
  - Basic TLS Connection: ✅ +20 points
  - Modern Server: ⚠️ +5 points
  - HTTP/2 Support: ❌ 0 points
  - HSTS Header: ⚠️ +5 points (short duration)
  - Legacy Client Rejected: ✅ +5 points
  - Modern Client Success: ✅ +10 points
  - Security Headers: ⚠️ +8 points
  - Certificate Consistency: ✅ +6 points
  - Total: 59/100 (59%)

Result: NON_COMPLIANT (just below 60% threshold)
Issues: Missing HTTP/2 support, weak HSTS configuration, incomplete security headers
Recommendations: Upgrade server software, implement proper HSTS, add missing security headers
Checklists: FAIL tls-cipher-strength-016, FAIL cryptographic-controls-017
Tags: tls-cipher-non-compliant, insufficient-cipher-suites
Vulnerabilities: missing_hsts (partial)
```

TLS Cipher Strength Assessment:
  - Basic TLS Connection: ❌ 0 points (connection failed)
  - All other tests: ❌ 0 points (cannot test)
  - Total: 0/100 (0%)

Result: NON_COMPLIANT (Insufficient)
Cipher Strength: "insufficient"
Issues: TLS connection failed, cannot establish secure connection
Recommendations: Fix TLS/SSL configuration to allow secure connections
Checklists: FAIL tls-cipher-strength-016, FAIL cryptographic-controls-017
Tags: tls-cipher-non-compliant, insufficient-cipher-suites
Vulnerabilities: tls_connection_failed
```

### Scenario 6: Non-TLS Service (NOT_APPLICABLE)
```
Input: example.com:22/tcp
Banner Grab: service.port.22 = "ssh", banner contains "SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.2p1"

Detection Result: Not a TLS service
Result: NOT_APPLICABLE
Checklists: N/A tls-cipher-strength-016, N/A cryptographic-controls-017
Tags: non-tls-service
```

## Integration Flow

### 1. TLS Service Detection
```lua
-- Uses banner_grab.lua results
local detected_service = get_metadata("service.port." .. port)
local service_banner = get_metadata("banner.port." .. port)
local service_confidence = get_metadata("service.confidence.port." .. port)
```

### 2. Comprehensive Testing Suite
```lua
-- Multiple connection tests with different configurations
assess_tls_cipher_strength(host, port, tls_service_info)

-- Tests include:
-- - Basic TLS connectivity
-- - Legacy client rejection
-- - Modern client support
-- - Security header analysis
-- - Protocol downgrade protection
```

### 3. Compliance Determination
```lua
-- Score-based compliance assessment with vulnerability consideration
if score_percentage >= 85 and vulnerabilities <= 1 then
    cipher_strength = "strong"
    compliance_status = "COMPLIANT"
elseif score_percentage >= 70 and vulnerabilities <= 2 then
    cipher_strength = "acceptable"  
    compliance_status = "COMPLIANT"
elseif score_percentage >= 50 then
    cipher_strength = "weak"
    compliance_status = "PARTIALLY_COMPLIANT"
else
    cipher_strength = "insufficient"
    compliance_status = "NON_COMPLIANT"
end
```
